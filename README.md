# Project Summary

This is an exercise in debugging code. There are four separate projects included that intentionally have bugs in them.  Your goal is to get each of the four projects up and running, with all the functionality intact.

The project is a basic application that allows you to navigate between the `home` view, the `store` view, and the `shopping cart` view.  You should be able to view products received from the provided URL -- `https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/products/` -- and add them to your shopping cart from the store view.  When in the shopping cart view, you should be able to see everything that you've added to your cart as well as be able to remove any items from it.

Note that 2 of the projects use redux and 2 of them do not.

Pay special attention to your debugging process.  It is a very large part of what developers do and refining that process can make the difference between a decent developer and a great one.

## Setup

* `fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into stage-1.
* Run `npm install` to install current dependencies.
* Run `npm start` to run the current stage.
* ( You will repeat these steps for each stage, though you will not have to fork and clone again )
